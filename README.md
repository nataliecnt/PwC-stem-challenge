We are Techie Prodigy, working on the Operation Management Project.
We use ARIMA model to forecast the no. of air passengers in Hong Kong in the coming 12 months. 
As it is a time series forecast, we cannot have explanatory variables in our forecasting model. Plus, it is rather difficult to do the adjustment. Hence, we turn to build a multiple time series regression by MS excel.
